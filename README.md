# Install Docker on Ubuntu using Ansible

This Ansible playbook automates the installation of Docker on Ubuntu using the APT repository by performing the exact steps described in the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

I know. There are plenty of alternative ways to do this, including much more structured solutions (such as Jeff Geerling's excellent [roled-based approach](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker)), but I wanted something minimalistic. That's it.
